# Tomorrow Theme
After having spent over five years using, tweaking and refining a personal editor theme I decided it was time to release "Tomorrow Theme" - a bright theme with pastel colours and sensible syntax highlighting. 

A theme should not get in your way but should aid your programming with easily identifiable colours that add meaning and enhance legibility. Hopefully, Tomorrow Theme achieves this but the jury is still out!

## Take a look!

## Language Support
The theme has been designed to be language independent and should look great with any language. However, if you find this isn't the case, just send me some sample code and I'll fix it!

## The Future?
I may be releasing other variations of this theme and will certainly be adding support for other editors (any suggestions?). The theme may even branch out from being an editor theme to more of a generic colour scheme used for colouring anything that can be themed i.e. ANSI terminal colours.
