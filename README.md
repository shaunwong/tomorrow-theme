# Tomorrow Theme
After more than five years in development and countless iterations I've finally decided to release the "Night" variation of my Tomorrow theme - a dark but colourful theme with pastel colours.

## What does it look like?

## Language Support
The theme has been designed whilst using Ruby, PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's quite possible it looks nice with other languages. If it doesn't, just send me some sample code and I'll give your language a tomorrow style!

## The Future?
I'd like to release some other variations of this theme and add support for other editors (any suggestions?). So far I'm working on adding support for Vim (full and 256 colour).
